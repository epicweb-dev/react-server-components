# Module Resolution

👨‍💼 Great! Now our server is all configured to create `'use client'` module
references to properly separate our client and server code. And our client is
configured to resolve those references to the client code necessary to run in
the browser and make the components stateful and interactive!

What's so cool about this is it allows us to have composition across the wire.
We can compose our client and server code together!

A common question at this point is "do I need to add `'use client'` to every
module I want in the client." The answer is no! You only need to add `'use
client'` to the top-level module that you want to run in the client. Think of
`'use client'` as a `<script>` tag in the browser. It's the entry point to your
client code (you can have many such entries). `'use client'` is a way to create
a boundry between the server and client code.
