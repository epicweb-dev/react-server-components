# Client Components

Rendering things on the server works well. We can even click on links and
because we have state in the URL (whether in URL segment params or search query
params), our application will update as the user navigates around. We could even
make our server handle form submissions if we wanted to as well. Doing this,
we'd be able to completely avoid client-side JavaScript.

But we're not in the business of avoiding client-side JavaScript. We're in the
business of excellent user experiences. And modern user experience demands
client-side JavaScript. But we want to keep the composibility of React
components in the client as well as the server. Especially because our RSC setup
enables mixing server-rendered components with client-rendered components.

## The Divide

Server components should be used for things that come from the server and don't
have client-side interactivity. For example, let's say you're building a todo
list. The list of items can be rendered by the server. And the button to mark
them as complete/uncomplete can even be rendered by the server as well.

However, if you want to implement optimistic UI for the checkbox to make the
user experience feel faster, you're going to need to manage state on the client
to simulate the update optimistically. This is a good example where you'd need
a client component.

Another example would be a combobox. You need to manage state for the input
value, the filter, the selected item, etc.

The great thing is that client and server components can be intermixed. But
there's an important caveat to how they're mixed as a result of the way server
components and client components interact.

## Caveats

There are some interesting caveats to consider when mixing client and server
components. The biggest one is the fact that server components can render client
components, but client components can't render server components.

Here's a simple example to explain why:

```jsx
'use client'
import { ServerComponent } from './server-component.js'

function ClientComponent() {
	// some client stuff
	return (
		<div>
			{/* some other stuff ...*/}
			<ServerComponent />
		</div>
	)
}
```

What happens when the `ClientComponent` renders? How would the client know
what the server component would render? By definition, the server component
code is not in the client, so it can't even have a reference to the server.

In fact, that `import` for the `./server-component.js` module would even work in
the client. That module could have secret environment variables or a database
connection etc.

So no, you cannot `import` server modules in client modules for safety reasons.

However, you can do the opposite. Client modules can be imported into server
modules. So if you need the structure of the example above, you would simply
change the structure:

```jsx
'use client'

function ClientComponent({ serverUI }) {
	// some client stuff
	return (
		<div>
			{/* some other stuff ...*/}
			{serverUI}
		</div>
	)
}
```

And then a parent server component would render the client component as well as
the server component like so:

```jsx
import { ClientComponent } from './client-component.js'
import { ServerComponent } from './server-component.js'

function App() {
	return <ClientComponent serverUI={<ServerComponent />} />
}
```

This composition is safe because server modules can only be imported by other
server modules, and client modules (which by definition are safe to send to the
client) are imported by both server and client modules.

## Client References

There's another caveat to this and that is: what do we do with the client
components in the serialized JSX? Remember that there are two ways to get UI to
React to render in the browser:

1. Data + Components in the client
2. RSC Payload

So when we're generating the RSC payload, should we include the client component
code in the payload? If we did, then we would be duplicating the client
component code in the payload and in the client bundle. This would be a waste
of space. More than that, if the client component has already rendered on the
client and has state changes already, then what do we do if we get an updated
RSC payload? Blow away those state changes?

No, we can't include client components in the RSC payload. So instead, the RSC
payload will include a placeholder for the client component. This placeholder
is a reference to the client component and the RSC payload will include
information on how to retrieve the module for the client component.

Let's take another look at an example RSC payload:

```json nonumber

```

We're not here to understand this format deeply (and it's possibly subject to
change anyway). So let's cut out some of the bits in the payload to focus a bit
and I'll format it to make it easier to read:

```json nonumber
...
2:I["/ship-search.js","ShipSearch"]
// ...
1:[
  "$",
  "div",
  null,
  {
    "className": "app",
    "children": [
      [
        "$",
        "div",
        null,
        {
          "className": "search",
          "children": [
            "$",
            "$L2",
            null,
            { "search": "m", "results": "$L3", "fallback": "$4" }
          ]
        }
      ],
      [
        // ...
      ]
    ]
  }
]
...
```

Notice there's an entry for the `I` type with the id of `2` and that's
referenced in the `1` entry by `$L2`.

So when React is processing the RSC payload, it sees that `$L2` is a reference,
it looks up that reference, sees that it's a client component and knows which
module to find it in. It imports `ShipSearch` from `/ship-search.js` and renders
it in that place.

This is how React avoids duplicating client component code in the RSC payload.

## `use client`

So then the question is, how do we avoid duplicating client component code in
the server when we're importing those modules and rendering them in our server
components?

The answer is the bundler you're using. When you're creating the RSC bundler,
you can tell it to replace certain modules with the reference to the client
module. And you tell it using the `'use client'`.

We can do this without a bundler by registering a custom
[Node.js loader](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#customization-hooks).
Luckily, for us, `react-server-dom-esm` exports a loader for us to use and as
this isn't a workshop about Node.js loaders, you won't be required to configure
it yourself. But it's important that you understand what it's doing. So we'll
have you toss a few `console.logs` around until you get it.

## Importing Client Components

One final thing you're going to need to understand about client components is
how they're loaded. You're not responsible for loading them yourself.

We hand off the RSC payload to `react-server-dom-esm/client` which will take
care of loading the client components for you. All we have to do is tell it
where to get the modules.

You'll recall from the RSC format above that the client modules look like this:

```json nonumber
2:I["/ship-search.js","ShipSearch"]
```

The first item in the array is the path to the module and the second item is
the name of the `export` in module. The full path to that module will be
something like
`file:///Users/kentcdodds/code/epicweb-dev/react-server-components/playground/ui/ship-search.js`.

So when we call `renderToPipeableStream` with the RSC payload, we'll also provide
`react-server-dom-esm/server` with a `moduleBasePath` option. This allows you to
control where the client modules can be loaded from the file system and used to
shorten the paths in the RSC payload:

```js
const moduleBasePath = new URL('../ui', import.meta.url).href
// moduleBasePath is something like `file:///Users/kentcdodds/code/epicweb-dev/react-server-components/playground/ui`
const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(payload, moduleBasePath)
```

With the full file path removed, we're left with the path to the module relative
to our `ui` directory. Our hono.js server is configured to serve any file in
`ui` via `/ui`.

Because `react-server-dom-esm/client` is responsible for loading that module for
us, we need to tell it the base URL to load modules from via an option called
`moduleBaseURL`:

```js
createFromFetch(fetchPromise, {
	moduleBaseURL: `${window.location.origin}/ui`,
})
```

Then when `react-server-dom-esm/client` needs to load a module, it will fetch
the module from `${window.location.origin}/ui/ship-search.js` and `import`
the `ShipSearch` `export` from it.
