// 🦉 normally you won't have to add a 'use client' for third party modules that
// are obviously client-only like this, but there's a bug in react-error-boundary
// for now, so we're going to add 'use client' to this module and that will make
// react-error-boundary only available in the client as well.

// 🐨 add the 'use client' pragma here

// 🐨 export everything from react-error-boundary
