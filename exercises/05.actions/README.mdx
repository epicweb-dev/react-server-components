# Server Actions

Most applications are better when you can interact with them and change the data
they display. This is called "mutation."

On the web, mutations happen via the `<form>` element. When you submit a form,
the browser sends a request to the server, which processes the data and sends
back a response.

The challenge with forms is there's a pretty significant amount of indirection.
The only thing connecting the form to the action it takes is the URL. If you're
a developer working on a web app, finding the code that handles a form
submission is often a challenge (and it's different in every app).

In React's quest to "compose all the things," React has a solution to this
problem in the form of "server actions."

Server actions are similar to client components in many ways. The RSC payload
carries with it a reference to the action you wish to perform and when the form
is submitted, the server gets that reference so it knows the right function to
call.

In practice, what this means is you get to pass a server-only function to a
client component and that component can call the function when it needs to.

Here's an example of this:

```jsx filename=ui/hug-koala.js
'use server'

import { giveBigHug } from './utils.js'

async function hugKoala(previousState, formData) {
	const koalaName = formData.get('koalaName')
	try {
		await giveBigHug(koalaName)
		return { status: 'success' }
	} catch (error) {
		return { status: 'error', error: error.message }
	}
}
```

```jsx filename=ui/koala-form.js
'use client'

import { useActionState } from 'react'
import { hugKoala } from './hug-koala.js'

function KoalaForm() {
	const [formState, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(hugKoala)

	return (
		<form action={formAction}>
			<label>
				Koala Name:
				<input type="text" name="koalaName" />
			</label>
			<button type="submit">{isPending ? 'Hugging...' : 'Hug Koala'}</button>
			{formState.status === 'error' ? <p>{formState.error}</p> : null}
			{formState.status === 'success' ? <p>Koala hugged!</p> : null}
		</form>
	)
}
```

That's all there is to it. For this to work, we need to make some client code
changes as well as server code changes.

## Client Changes

`react-server-dom-esm` is responsible for handling our server actions when
they're called. To do this, we configure a `callServer` function when we call
`createFromFetch`. This makes sense because the server is going to send the
actions references within the payload so its at that time that we need to
tell it what to do with those action references.

The `callServer` function will receive an `id` and `args`. The `id` is the
server action reference and the `args` are the arguments that the server action
needs to run (the form data).

```js
import * as RSC from 'react-server-dom-esm/client'

function callServer(id, args) {
  const fetchPromise = fetch(`/action${getGlobalLocation()}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'rsc-action': id },
    body: await RSC.encodeReply(args),
  })
  // handle the fetchPromise similar to how we handle other content fetch
  // promises
}
```

Things get a little tricky here because this needs to be defined outside our
component, but needs to update state within our component. That's an
implementation detail we'll explore within the exercise.

## Server Changes

The server needs to handle the action that the client is sending. This is done
by parsing the `rsc-action` header, parsing the request body and calling the
appropriate function with the given arguments.

One part of this is the need to return the result of the action to the client
along with the updated RSC payload. So we change the payload from just the root
element to an object with `root` and `returnValue` properties which we can then
use on the client as needed.
