# RSCs

👨‍💼 Right now we have to load all the data of our app and pass the result as
props to our components. Additionally, we're sending a bunch of code to the
client to render a page that really doesn't need to be on the client. We want
you to solve both of these problems by using `react-server-dom-esm` which will
allow us to generated serialized JSX on the server and render it in the browser.

## 🦉 `react-server` export

One important thing to remember is that on the server, React components cannot
use hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc. You should think of RSCs as a
one-time template because they'll never be interactive.

This can be confusing and even cause problems if you're not careful. That's why
React packages have a special version for your RSC server so you don't make this
mistake. You actually don't have to change your code at all for this to work.
Instead, you change the environment in which your code is running.

On the server, Node.js has an algorithm to resolve module imports like `react`
and `react-server-dom-esm`. It's a fair bit complex, so to be brief, I'll just
say that in the `package.json` of react packages, you'll find something like
this:

```json
{
	"exports": {
		".": {
			"react-server": "./react.react-server.js",
			"default": "./index.js"
		},
		"./package.json": "./package.json",
		"./jsx-runtime": {
			"react-server": "./jsx-runtime.react-server.js",
			"default": "./jsx-runtime.js"
		},
		"./jsx-dev-runtime": "./jsx-dev-runtime.js"
	}
}
```

This is configuration for the node resolver so the correct version of React is
resolved based on the environment. In our RSC environment, we want to tell Node
to resolve to the `react-server` export.

This is done by setting the `--conditions` flag in the `node` command. This flag
is used to set the environment in which the code is running. In our case, we
want to set the environment to `react-server`.

🐨 So before you do anything else, update the `dev` script in
the <InlineFile file="package.json" /> file to add `--conditions=react-server`:

```
node --watch --conditions=react-server server/app.js
```

Once you have that done, you can restart your dev server and for any package
that has a special export for an RSC environment, Node will resolve to that
version of the package.

## 👨‍💼 Continue

Great, from here, you can proceed to
update <InlineFile file="public/index.html" /> to properly map the
`react-server-dom-esm/client` import to the correct URL. Once you have that
done, you can update <InlineFile file="server/app.js" /> to switch from an
`/api` route that serves data to an `/rsc` route that serves the RSCs.

Then finally you'll be able to go to the <InlineFile file="src/index.js" /> file
and update that to fetch the RSCs from the server and render them using the
`react-server-dom-esm/client` package.
