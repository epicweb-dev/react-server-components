# Server Context

üë®‚Äçüíº It's kind of annoying to have to send the `search` and `shipId` props down
through the `App` to all our components below. It would be nice if we could
use context to share these values...

ü¶â One of the limitations of React Server Components is the lack of support for
React Context.

React Server Components can absolutely render components that use context:

```jsx
async function MyServerComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<MyCombobox>
				<MyComboboxLabel>Pet Chooser</MyComboboxLabel>
				<MyComboboxInput />
			</MyCombobox>
		</div>
	)
}
// assume MyCombobox is a client component that uses context
```

But they can't `useContext` themselves.

This is a bummer because another benefit of context is avoiding prop drilling
for things like the user object, theme, or localization.

Luckily for us, Node.js has an answer. Again, this isn't a Node.js workshop,
but this is a common problem that you'll experience when using RSCs and this
is the solution recommended by the React team.

The answer is [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html).
Here's a simple example from the docs:

```js
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from 'node:async_hooks'

const userStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage()

// somewhere later in your code
const user = await getUser()
try {
	userStorage.run(user, () => {
		logUser() // Returns the user object
		setTimeout(() => {
			logUser() // Logs the user object
		}, 200)
		throw new Error()
	})
} catch (e) {
	logUser() // Logs undefined
}

function logUser() {
	const user = userStorage.getStore()
	console.log({ user })
}
```

It's a little magical, but the idea is that you can store a value in the
`AsyncLocalStorage` and then access it from anywhere in your code, so long as
the async operation was created within the `run` callback.

üë®‚Äçüíº Great, thanks Olivia! So what I want you to do is use this to make the
`search` and `shipId` values available to all components in the tree without
having to pass them down as props.

üê® First you'll want to create a module to create our async storage object. So
let's start by creating <InlineFile file="server/async-storage.js" /> and stick
this in there:

```js
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from 'node:async_hooks'

export const shipDataStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage()
```

From there, you can import it in <InlineFile file="server/app.js" /> to provide
the `search` and `shipId` to the rendered components, remove all the prop
drilling from <InlineFile file="src/app.js" /> and access the values necessary
from the async storage in <InlineFile file="src/ship-details.js" />
and <InlineFile file="src/ship-search-results.js" />.
